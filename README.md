This is a Jupyter Notebook I used to see how students did on a midterm.

Here, I used Python for things I had previously used R to do (see my
[exam-evaluation-made-easy-1](https://github.com/captainalan/exam-evaluation-made-easy-1)
for an example of that).

Feel free to copy/re-use/etc. this code; MIT license included in this repository
to express that.
